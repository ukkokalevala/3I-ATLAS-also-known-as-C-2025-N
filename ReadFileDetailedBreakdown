Detailed Breakdown
1. Object Identification:
•	Full Name: C/2025 N1 (ATLAS)
•	Designation: 2025 N1
•	Type: Comet ("kind":"cu")
•	Orbit Class: Hyperbolic Comet (HYP) - This means its orbit is not bound to the solar system; it will likely pass through and exit again.
•	Not a NEO: "neo":false - It is not a Near-Earth Object.
•	Not PHA: "pha":false - It is not classified as Potentially Hazardous.
2. Orbital Elements (as of the epoch date):
These values define the comet's path around the sun.
•	Epoch: 2460878.5 (A specific date in the Julian calendar for which these elements are calculated).
•	Eccentricity (e): 6.14 - This confirms its hyperbolic orbit (e > 1).
•	Perihelion Distance (q): 1.36 au - It will come within 1.36 astronomical units of the Sun (inside the orbit of Mars).
•	Inclination (i): 175° - Its orbit is highly inclined and retrograde (angled more than 90°, meaning it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets).
•	Longitude of Asc. Node (node): 322°
•	Argument of Perihelion (peri): 128°
•	Time of Perihelion (tp): 2460977.981 (Julian Date) - This corresponds to September 17, 2025.
•	Mean Motion (n): 7.27 deg/day - Its speed in its orbit.
3. Observation Details:
•	First Observation: 2025-05-15
•	Last Observation: 2025-08-27
•	Data Arc: 104 days of observations.
•	Number of Observations: 603
•	Orbit Solution Date: 2025-09-08 18:29:13 - The date this precise orbit was calculated.
4. Close Approach Data (MOID):
•	Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID): 0.364 au (~54.4 million km / ~33.8 million miles). This is a very safe distance (over 140 times the distance to the Moon).
•	Jupiter MOID: 0.247 au - It will also pass a safe distance from Jupiter.
In Simple Terms:
This data tells us that Comet ATLAS (C/2025 N1) is a one-time visitor from interstellar space or the far outer Oort cloud. It will make its closest approach to the Sun around September 17, 2025, staying outside Earth's orbit. Its path is steeply tilted and backwards compared to the planets. Based on the current data, it poses no threat to Earth.
